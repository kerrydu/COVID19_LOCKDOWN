**Abstract:** The rapid spread of COVID 19 is a global public health challenge. To prevent the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one third of its cities and strictly restrict ed personal mobility and economic activities. Using timely and comprehensive air quality data in China we show that these counter COVID 19 measures led to a remarkable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration s were brought down by 25\% The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities. We estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature death s from air pollution on a monthly basis.
